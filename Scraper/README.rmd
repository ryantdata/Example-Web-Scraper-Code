This is a sanitised example of my code from previous employment for a web scraper engineered to be quickly adaptable and reusable. 
The code reduced the length of time it took me to build scrapers by 50%-70%.

The code is not a working example as it has been sanitised to avoid giving away any specific information in regards to it's function.

The global folder holds base classes so that the functionality could be injected into multiple projects via 1 layer of inheritance and also enforce mandatory functions,
should custom functionality for a particular project be required. The local folder holds code specific to a project.

At runtime, the global and local folders were merged.

All dependencies were wrapped in a global object in the main file in the global folder and passed into the scraper to make access
to variables and functionality easier, and also to improve code readability.
